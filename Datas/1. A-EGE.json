Even in this sense the word is rare after xı except in the Neg. f. The Pres. Particip. uğa:n, however, used as a N./A. meaning 'God; Almighty' survived rather longer. The later history of the Neg. f. is discussed by Mal. in USp., pp. 224-5. Briefly the Ger. suff. -u:/-ü: and u:- coalesced to produce -uma-/-üme- the 'Impossible' f. of the verb. This stage was reached in Osm. in the early medieval period, but later, probably as the result of a general tendency to 'unround' round vowels, this became -ama-/-eme-, producing such forms as Osm. seveme- 'to be unable to love'. It has been suggested that in such forms the -a-/-e- is a reduced form of al- which is used as an Aux. verb in the same sense in some modern languages, but this is improbable. It is more plausible that the Osm. Continuous Pres. Suff. -uyor (not subject to phonetic harmony) is a survival of the positive form of u:-.

This attenuation occurred chiefly in the Western languages; the Eastern languages, perhaps for the colourful reason given by Kaş., rather avoided the word and continued to use kıl- for 'to make, do.' S.i.a.m.l.g., nearly always for 'to make, do', but in most languages used chiefly to form compound verbs out of foreign, esp. Ar. nouns.
